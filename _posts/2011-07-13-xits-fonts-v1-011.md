title: XITS fonts v1.011
---
Though v1.010 was promised to be the last release, I'm resuming work on the fonts, so here is a new beta of  [XITS fonts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XITS_font_project), featuring mainly support for right-to-left math which [have been the main motivate]({{ site.url }}/2009/11/03/arabic-math.html) behind the project, though never made it to any of the released versions (only supported by LuaTeX for now, more on that later). This release also features support for [Unicode standardised math variants](http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/StandardizedVariants.html) using [variation selector VS1](http://unicode.org/reports/tr25/tr25-9.html#_Toc218), as well as alternate negated symbols [using vertical stroke](http://unicode.org/reports/tr25/tr25-9.html#_Toc217) (instead of the slanted one).

As usual, it can be downloaded from [github](https://github.com/khaledhosny/xits-math/downloads).
