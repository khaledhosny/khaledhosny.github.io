excerpt: Since the first public announce of the [http://www.khaledhosny.org/node/143
  XITS] font, there have been 6 beta releases and I think the font is now more or
  less ready for more widespread use. The font is derived from STIX fonts and is thus
  under OFL, the development repository is hosted on [http://github.com/khaledhosny/xits-math
  githup]. So all wonderful distribution packagers out there, please let me know if
  there is anything that needs to be done to facilitate packaging (anything but make
  files, patches are welcomed, though).
