title: Packaging XITS font
---
Since the first public announce of the [XITS]({{ site.url }}/2010/06/04/first-stix-and-now-xits.html) font, there have been 6 beta releases and I think the font is now more or less ready for more widespread use. The font is derived from STIX fonts and is thus under OFL, the development repository is hosted on [githup](http://github.com/khaledhosny/xits-math). So all wonderful distribution packagers out there, please let me know if there is anything that needs to be done to facilitate packaging (anything but make files, patches are welcomed, though).
