[Nafees Nastaleeq](http://www.crulp.org/software/localization/Fonts/nafeesNastaleeq.html) font is a great [Nasta'liq](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasta%60liq_script) (AKA Farsi) style font that supports mainly Urdu but some Arabic characters still missing. The font is very carefully designed and looks almost like hand written calligraphy, I'm really impressed by the amount of effort spent to develop such font. What impresses me more is that the latest version was released under a free license.
