It has been long since last time I posted here, and there has been many recent developments.

I started a project to for digitisation of the standard Arabic typeface developed and used by Al-Amiria printing in Cairo from around 20s to 70s of the last century that was widely used in other governmental printing houses as well. The project has been funded by <a href="http://tug.org/tc/devfund/grants.html">TUG</a>, see the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/amiri/">google code page</a> of the project for more details (and if you want to donate to the project ;).)

I'm also taking over <a href="http://l10n.gnome.org/teams/ar">Arabic Gnome</a> translation maintainership from <a href="http://djihed.com>Djihed</a> who has been busy recently, thanks Djihed for all the great work you have been doing for gnome in the past years.

As part of the typography fun I'm having these days I was doing some little contributions to <a href="http://luatex.org">LuaTeX</a> typesetting engine and <a href="http://wiki.contextgarden.net">ConTeXt</a> typesetting system based on it. It was fun and I learnt some <href="http://lua.org>lua</a> and pascal for this, that what I call fun :).

I've been doing some translation work on Thunderbird 3 beta and the upcoming Firefox 3.1. Worked on OLPC <a href="http://sugarlabs.org">Sugar</a> Arabisation and fixing some RTL bugs.

Most probably I did a dozen of other things that I forgot ;).

On the real life side, I passed my Surgery and Gynaecology exams, even got good and very good grades. This means I've only one exam left and will be essentially graduated.
