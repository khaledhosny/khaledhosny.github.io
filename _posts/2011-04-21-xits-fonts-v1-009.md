Just released a new version of [http://www.khaledhosny.org/node/143 XITS] fonts for [http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/xits.html scientific and mathematical] typesetting, no much change from previous beta; fixing an issue (inherited from [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3127933&group_id=328428&atid=1378225 upstream]) that breaks breaks printing with Ghostscript, and fine tuning of [http://tug.org/pipermail/lualatex-dev/2011-March/001137.html two math parameters]. It can be downloaded from [https://github.com/khaledhosny/xits-math/downloads the usual place], and if you are using TeXLive you should get an update in due time.

The fonts have been available for a while and many people are happily using them with no major complaints, so I decided this will be the final beta and if no major bugs get discovered the next release will be v2.000 and there will be no more releases except to sync with upstream (if they ever make a 1.1 release).

'''''Update''': v1.010 have been just uploaded, and it is likely to be the last release from me, volunteers are welcomed.''
