excerpt: Today on IRC, Mr. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Gettys Jim Gettys] kindly
  invited me to apply to the [http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Developer_program  OLPC Developers
  Program] So that I can get a developer  machine and start testing various aspects
  related to Arabic localization and support on the system, I think I'll also start
  working on the localization of the interface to Arabic ASAP. I'm waiting for the
  machine and lets see what we can do.
