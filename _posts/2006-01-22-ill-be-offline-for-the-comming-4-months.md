Becouse of the  troubles that I've at home as a result of my computing addiction, my parents decided that "No computing at home untill the end of exames", I can't say no to this, so I'll be away from using computer in general till the end of exames which may be in 6/2006 or at the starts of 7/2006.

This makes me very sad, but i can't resist my parants in thing like this which they consider as a critical decision.

Bye Bye computer, Bye Bye GNU/Linux, Bye Bye EGLUG.
