I just uploaded the seventh beta of XITS scientific fonts (don't let the beta label mislead you `;)` it is quite functional).  No bug changes, just few bug fixes and small additions:

- Add TopAccentHorizontal position to U+00B7, U+0131, U+0237, U+203E, U+22C5
- Add spaces and control characters U+0000-001F, U+2000-200F, U+2028-202F
- Tune script positioning for display integrals
- Disable smaller that text size integrals
- Rename fj ligature glyph to `f_j` for PDF search
- Assign un-encoded glyphs PUA code points
- Use U+23B7 slot for the glyph uni221A.base
- Change integral glyphs name suffixes to "small" and "display"

Get it from the [usual place](http://github.com/khaledhosny/xits-math/downloads).

***Update****: The new release is also available through TeXLive updates.*
