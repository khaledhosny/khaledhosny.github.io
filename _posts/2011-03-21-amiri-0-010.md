Yesterday I released version 0.010 of [https://sourceforge.net/projects/amiri/files/ Amiri font], codenamed Referendum :)
<!--break-->
Just a minor release, no big changes:
<pre>
* New glyphs:
  - Lam with three dots below (U+06B8).

* Kerning:
  - Lam of له with preceding Raa/Waw family.
  - Kaf of كتب as well.

* Glyph fixes:
  - Fixed exclamation mark's vertical position as compared to question mark.
  - Removed stray Hamza from U+063B and U+063C initial and medial forms.
  - Fixed the weight of isolated Dal, was much bolder than the rest of the font.
  - Fixed Lam Meem connection in لما, there was a slight mismatch.
  - Fixed the size of medial Ayn compared to the head of final one.

* OpenType code:
  - Removed DFLT script from 'locl' feature which would cause it to be on
    unconditionally.
  - Got rid of mark sets in favour of the more widely supported mark classes.
</pre>
