Yet another developmental release of [Amiri font](http://www.amirifont.org "Amiri font website"), this time featuring a, more or less, complete Quranic support, which fixes the last major issue with the font, and I think it is only a couple of more alpha releases before it is ready to enter beta stage.

Here is the full release notes:

Amiri 0.016 (2011-09-22), Beginning of the End
----------------------------------------------
* This release features full Quranic support, another major developmental
  milestone, more work still needed in refining glyph interaction specially
  mark positioning in fully vocalised text such as Quran.

* New glyphs:
  - All Quranic annotation marks in Unicode 6.0.
  - All other Arabic vowel marks in Unicode 6.0.
  - Radical (U+221A) including a RTL variant, and other Arabic radicals
    (U+0606, U+0607).
  - Arabic ray (U+0608).
  - Afghani sign (U+060B).
  - Arabic sign Misra (U+060F).
  - New contextual shape for initial meem followed by medial heh, as in مها.

* Kerning:
  - Decreased the number of kerning pairs from 411240 to 55850 while retaining
    the same functionality.

* Fixes:
  - General cleanup of punctuation marks, fixing spacing of brackets and making
    curly brackets more bolder to fit wit the rest of the font.
  - Made the space glyph 600 units wide.
  - Fixed erroneous tatweel (kashida) insertion in full justification.
  - Wider forms of some glyphs to avoid mark clash in full vowelisation.
  - Underline position is now lower than most glyphs with descendants.
  - Various mark positioning fixes.
  - Separate the ring of Kashmiri yeh from the body of base glyph, following
    Kashmiri orthographic traditions.
