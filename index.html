    <p>
      I’m <em>Khaled Hosny</em> (<span lang="ar">خالد حسني</span>), a type
      designer and software developer from Egypt. I’m also an aspiring
      calligrapher, amateur painter, and an avid book reader.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been contributing to and maintaining Free Software projects since
      2005. I have no formal education in design or programming. I learned
      everything I know through self-study and practice, and if it wasn’t for
      the Free Software community, I’d not have had access to the software
      resources to study and learn from.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve been designing Arabic typefaces since 2008. I started with
      <a href="https://aliftype.com/amiri"><em>Amiri</em></a
      >, which is yet my most famous work, it even got its own
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiri_(typeface)">Wikipedia Page</a
      >. I have since designed many other typefaces, like
      <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Mada"><em>Mada</em></a
      >,
      <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Reem+Kufi"
        ><em>Reem Kufi</em></a
      >, <a href="https://aliftype.com/rana-kufi/"><em>Rana Kufi</em></a
      >, <a href="https://aliftype.com/qahiri"><em>Qahiri</em></a
      >, and <a href="https://aliftype.com/raqq"><em>Raqq</em></a
      >. I have a few more unpublished typefaces that I hope to complete and
      publish one day. I started a type foundry,
      <a href="https://aliftype.com">Alif Type</a>, where I publish my
      typefaces, and many of them are also available on
      <a href="https://fonts.google.com/?query=Khaled+Hosny">Google Fonts</a>. I
      also do font engineering for other type foundries and designers.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have a weak spot for mathematical typesetting (even though I don’t
      understand much of mathematical notation, since I studied mathematics in
      Arabic notation, and even that I have long forgotten), and I have worked
      on engineering a few math typefaces over the years, like
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XITS_font_project">XITS Math</a>,
      <a href="https://www.tug.org/store/lucida/index.html">Lucida Math</a>,
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertinus">Libertinus Math</a>,
      <a href="https://fonts.nagwa.com/tk/"><em>Nagwa</em> TK Math</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/IBM/plex">IBM Plex Math</a>, and
      <a href="https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans+Math"
        >Noto Sans Math</a
      >. I even developed a
      <a href="https://github.com/Nagwa-Limited-Community/Glyphs-MATH-Plugin"
        >GlyphsApp plugin</a
      >
      for developing math typefaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have always had a passion for Arabic calligraphy, and I tried to
      self-learn calligraphy but never managed to be good at it on my own. When
      I got introduced to computers, and later to type design, I thought if I
      can’t be good at calligraphy, may be I can get the computer to do it for
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      It wasn’t until 2019 that I started to learn calligraphy the proper way on
      the hands of a master calligrapher. I started with various
      <em>Kufic</em> styles that are <em>drawn</em> with a pencil and a ruler.
      Later I moved to calligraphy styles that are written with a reed pen,
      starting with <em>Diwani</em> followed by <em>Naskh</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have contributed to many Free Software projects over the years. My
      contributions mostly evolve around improving the support for Arabic
      language and script, and text layout and font rendering in general.
      Projects I contributed to include
      <a href="https://gnome.org/">Gnome</a>,
      <a href="https://gtk.org/">GTK</a>,
      <a href="https://gtk.org/docs/architecture/pango">Pango</a>,
      <a href="https://tug.org/xetex/">XeTeX</a>,
      <a href="https://luatex.org/">LuaTeX</a>,
      <a href="https://fontforge.org/">FontForge</a>,
      <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>,
      <a href="https://www.scribus.net/">Scribus</a>,
      <a href="https://libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a>. I still actively
      contribute to many projects like
      <a href="https://github.com/harfbuzz"><em>HarfBuzz</em></a
      >, <a href="https://github.com/HOST-Oman/libraqm"><em>Raqm</em></a
      >, and <a href="https://github.com/fonttools">FontTools</a>.

      I graduated from medical school in 2010. I originally wanted to practice
      surgery (back then, for me, type design or software development was just a
      distracting hobby). However, in 2011 I suffered an injury that left me
      unable to stand for extended periods of time without suffering from a
      considerable pain. I opted for working as a radiologist instead. It didn’t
      work out for me, and in 2014 when I had to choose between medicine and
      another career, I quit medicine for good.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m a not very social person, and I’m usually shy when meeting new people.
      If you see me around, feel free to say hi!
