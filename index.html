    <p>
      My name is <em>Khaled Hosny</em> (<span lang="ar">خالد حسني</span>). I’m a
      type designer, and software developer specializing in fonts, text layout,
      and Arabic support. I’m also an aspiring calligrapher, amateur painter,
      and avid book reader. I’m currently based in Cairo, Egypt.
    </p>
    <p>
      I got my first computer in 2002, with little prior experience. One thing
      led to another and I became a Linux user. Shortly after, I learnt about
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabeyes">Arabeyes</a>, a project
      dedicated to improving the support for Arabic language in Free Software. I
      joined and started contributing by first translating software and
      documentation, and later maintaining a collection of Arabic fonts.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been contributing to and maintaining Free Software projects since
      2005. I have no formal education in design or programming. I learned
      everything I know through self-study and practice, and if it wasn’t for
      the Free Software community, I’d not have had access to the software
      resources to study and learn from.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have contributed to many Free Software projects over the years. My
      contributions mostly revolve around improving the support for Arabic
      language and script, and text layout and font rendering in general.
      Projects I contributed to include
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabeyes">Arabeyes</a>,
      <a href="https://gnome.org/">Gnome</a>,
      <a href="https://gtk.org/">GTK</a>,
      <a href="https://gtk.org/docs/architecture/pango">Pango</a>,
      <a href="https://www.firefox.com/">Firefox</a>,
      <a href="https://tug.org/xetex/">XeTeX</a>,
      <a href="https://luatex.org/">LuaTeX</a>,
      <a href="https://fontforge.org/">FontForge</a>,
      <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>,
      <a href="https://www.scribus.net/">Scribus</a>, and
      <a href="https://libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a>. I still actively
      contribute to many projects like
      <a href="https://github.com/harfbuzz"><em>HarfBuzz</em></a
      >, <a href="https://github.com/HOST-Oman/libraqm"><em>Raqm</em></a
      >, and <a href="https://github.com/fonttools">FontTools</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have always had a passion for Arabic calligraphy, and I tried to
      self-learn calligraphy but never managed to be good at it on my own. When
      I got introduced to computers, and later to type design, I thought if I
      couldn’t master calligraphy myself, perhaps I can get the computer to do
      it for me. Anyone experienced in calligraphy or type design can tell how
      naïve that idea was. While calligraphy and typography are closely related,
      they have very different requirements, strengths, and constraints. I
      didn’t know better at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I started working on my first typeface,
      <a href="https://aliftype.com/amiri"><em>Amiri</em></a
      >, in 2008. It remains my most famous work, with its own
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiri_(typeface)"
        >Wikipedia Page</a
      >
      and all. I have since designed many other typefaces, like
      <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Mada"><em>Mada</em></a
      >,
      <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Reem+Kufi"
        ><em>Reem Kufi</em></a
      >, <a href="https://aliftype.com/rana-kufi/"><em>Rana Kufi</em></a
      >, <a href="https://aliftype.com/qahiri"><em>Qahiri</em></a
      >, and <a href="https://aliftype.com/raqq"><em>Raqq</em></a
      >. I have a few more unpublished typefaces that I hope to complete and
      publish one day. I started a type foundry,
      <a href="https://aliftype.com"><em>Alif</em> Type</a>, where I publish my
      typefaces, and many of them are also available on
      <a href="https://fonts.google.com/?query=Khaled+Hosny">Google Fonts</a>. I
      also do font engineering for other type foundries and designers.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have a weak spot for mathematical typesetting, even though I don’t
      understand much of mathematical notation, since I studied mathematics in
      Arabic notation, and much of which I have since forgotten. I have worked
      on engineering a few math typefaces over the years, like
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XITS_font_project">XITS Math</a>,
      <a href="https://www.tug.org/store/lucida/index.html">Lucida Math</a>,
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertinus">Libertinus Math</a>,
      <a href="https://fonts.nagwa.com/tk/"><em>Nagwa</em> TK Math</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/IBM/plex">IBM Plex Math</a>, and
      <a href="https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans+Math"
        >Noto Sans Math</a
      >. I even developed a
      <a href="https://github.com/Nagwa-Limited-Community/Glyphs-MATH-Plugin"
        >GlyphsApp plugin</a
      >
      for developing math typefaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      It wasn’t until 2019 that I started to learn calligraphy the proper way at
      the hands of a master calligrapher. I started with various
      <em>Kufic</em> styles that are drawn with a pencil and a ruler at
      <a href="https://www.facebook.com/alqalm.co/"><em>Al Qalam</em></a
      >. Later I moved to calligraphy styles that are written with a reed pen,
      starting with <em>Diwani</em> followed by <em>Naskh</em> at
      <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/calligraphy.in.azhar/"
        ><em>Al Azhar</em></a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      I graduated from medical school in 2010. I originally planned to practice
      surgery, viewing type design and software development as mere hobbies at
      the time. However, a physical condition led me to reconsider surgery, and
      I explored radiology instead. It didn’t work out for me, and in 2014 when
      I had to choose between medicine and another career, I quit medicine for
      good.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2013 I started working at
      <a href="https://translatehouse.org/">Translate House</a> as a Software
      Developer and Localization Engineer. Working on projects like
      <a href="https://pootle.translatehouse.org/">Pootle</a>, and
      <a href="https://toolkit.translatehouse.org/">Translate Toolkit</a>, among
      other things.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2014 I started working at
      <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/">Hindawi Publishing Corporation</a> as a
      senior Document Engineer, where I worked with TeX, XML, PDF and other
      typesetting and scientific publishing technologies.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2015 I moved to Muscat, Oman, for 6 months to work for the
      <a href="https://www.ita.gov.om/">Information Technology Authority</a> as
      a Consultant, mentoring a group of fresh graduates on contributing to Free
      Software projects, where we wrote
      <a href="https://github.com/HOST-Oman/libraqm"><em>Raqm</em></a
      >, and contributed Arabic and advanced text layout support to
      <a href="https://www.scribus.net/">Scribus</a>, among other things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between 2017 and 2019 I worked at
      <a href="https://motoon.org/">Motoon</a> as a localization specialist, and
      various other roles (at two occasions, I taught 8-14 year olds programming
      using <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a> and
      <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2023, I worked for
      <a href="https://www.documentfoundation.org/">The Document Foundation</a>
      as a software developer, to work mainly on
      <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a> text layout and
      right-to-left support.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don’t currently have a full-time job, and I’m working as a
      <a href="https://aliftype.com">freelance type designer</a>, font engineer,
      as well as a software developer in areas related to fonts and text layout.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, I’m not a very social person, and I’m usually shy when meeting
      new people. If you see me around, feel free to say hi!
